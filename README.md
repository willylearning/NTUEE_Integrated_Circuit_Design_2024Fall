# NTUEE Integrated Circuit Design 2024 Fall
## HW1 - Layout Reading
Draw the associated sticky diagram and the circuit in transistor level, and describe the function of the circuits for 10 layouts

## HW2 - SPICE
Write the SPICE netlist for a 4-bit carry propagation adder

## HW3 - Layout
Layout a 4-bit full adder in Virtuoso, an integrated editor provided by Cadence

## HW4 - Verilog-HDL
